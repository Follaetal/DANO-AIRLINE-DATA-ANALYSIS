### Introduction
#### Project Overview
This Project is an analysis for Dano Airlines, a Uk-based airline headquartered in London, United Kingdom. The latest passenger survey results just came in and it looks
like the satisfaction rate dipped under 50% for the first time ever. Hence, the need to take actions to reverse the decline. The survey was done with the use of ratings from 1-5. This analysis aims to find the unsatisfactory services of the airline and recommend solutions so as to improve the services of the airline.

#### Data Source
This data was provided at the completion of the Data Analytics cohort.

#### Tools
- Power Query (Data loading and Data transformation)
- Power BI (Data Visualization)
  
### Data Preparation
- Data cleaning : This is an important step in order to ensure an accurate analysis in order to draw helpful insights. In this case, the data was loaded into Power query where null values in the ratings were replaced with 0 which is synonymous to being neutral or unsatisfied. The data types were also corrected. This data cleaning allowed us to see the structure of the data for better understanding.
- The data was loaded into the visualization tool, Microsoft Power BI which was used to visualize the sums, counts, average and other functions in order to properlyy analyse the data.
  
### Exploratory Data Analysis 
EDA aims to answer important questions in the dataset.
1. What are the factors that must have led or contributed to over 50% of the passengers being unsatisfied?
2. What are the strenghts and weaknesses of the airline?
3. Are natural factors such as age and gender to be considered as possible reasons for the problems encountered?
4. Which of the staff group contributes to the satisfaction rate?

### Data Analysis
With the use of Power BI, I was able to see, firstly, the current situation of the airline which is visualized below.
